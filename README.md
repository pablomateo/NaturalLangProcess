# Natural Language Processing

This project is part of **UdacityÂ´s Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program**. Here you will find my personal solution to the challenge. The following project can be run using a Local Machine or using an external GPU (Solution provided by **Amazon Web Services** is recommended). Next, you can follow Udacitys instructions to install the necessary dependencies on a local machine or on AWS.


Follow the instructions to install the required environment and check the jupyter notebook files:

    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb
    
    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook text_processing.ipynb

### Instructions - Udacity Project

Coding exercises for the Natural Language Processing concentration, part of Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree program.

## Setup

You need Python 3.6+, and the packages mentioned in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Data files for exercises are included under `data/`, but some of the NLP libraries require additional data for performing tasks like 
PoS tagging, lemmatization, etc. Specifically, `nltk` will throw an error if the required data is not installed. You can use the 
following Python statement to open the NLTK downloader and select the desired package(s) to install:

```python
nltk.download()
```

You can also download all available NLTK data packages, which includes a number of sample corpora as well, but that may take a while 
(10+GB).

## Run

To run any script file, use:

```bash
python <script.py>
```

To open a notebook, use:

```bash
jupyter notebook <notebook.ipynb>
```
